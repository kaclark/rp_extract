Rennovated by: Keanu Clark<br/><br/>
This project was written in Python 2. I am porting this to work on termux for a pixel 6, meaning fortran in scipy will not work.<br/> 
===============================<br/><br/>

Goals:<br/>
[ ] Python 3 syntax conversion<br/>
[ ] scipy to numpy conversion<br/>
[ ] wavio re-tool<br/>
[ ] Test load_audiofile.py<br/>
[ ] Test rp_extract.py<br/>

RP_extract is a Python library to extract semantic features (so called audio descriptors) from audio files (WAV, MP3, ...)
which can be used in tasks such as finding similar sounding music, creating playlists or recommender systems,
categorizing music into a custom set of categories such as genres, and detecting concepts such as moods and emotions in music.
Most of these tasks are achieved through employing Machine Learning, example implementations are provided in this
repository and the tutorials included.
